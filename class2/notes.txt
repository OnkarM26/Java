java 3 types:
    (1) J2SE :  For developing standalone app
                For developing client apps

    (2) J2EE :  For developing enterprise application (client server)
                For developing web applications

    (3) J2ME :  

Types of Programming Languages:
    (1) Scripting :
        For executing we need statements
        Ex. JS,perl,python,shell etc
            test.js 
            console.log("Hello World!!");
            >> node test.js

    (2) Functional :
        For executing we need functions
        Ex. c,python etc
            test.py 
            def main();
                print("Hello world!!")

            main()
            >> py test.py

    (3) OOPS :
        For executing we need objects, class
        Ex.Java,JS,Python etc

    why to set class path: OS will know path of .exe file
    compile java file and execute class
        compile : javac file name
        execute: java class name

    At time of compilation: just verify syntax and generate byte code i.e. .class file

    class is a template, data type, plan/design to construct object

    If class name is public then file name should be public
	
	Java class (capital)
		(1) User Defined
		(2) Inbuilt class
		
	To print something on terminal: System.out.printin("First Program");
	write per file one java class
	
	Bytecode: set of optimized instruction provided by compiler(JVM)

    name in javaprogram: Identifier
    java is static(Perticular data type) and strongly/strictly typed PL i.e.
    every java statement ends with semicolon.

Rules for Identifier:
    (1) Identifier contains (a to z),(A to Z),(0 to 9), _
    (2) It shouldn't start  with 0 to 9
    (3) It shouldn't contain any special char/symbol
    (4) Case sensitive
    (5) Keyword shouldn't use as Identifier 

    java : 50 +2 keywords
    JS : 65 keywords
    python : 35 + 1 keywords

Keywords:
    - byte,short,int,long,float,double,char,boolean (Data Type)
    - true,false (boolean)
    - if-else,for,while,do,break,continue,switch[case,break,default],return (control flow)
    - public,private,protected,default,static,abstract,synchronised,final ()
    - class,enum,inheritance,extends,implements,new,this (OOPS)
    - try, catch,finally,throw,through (error handeling)

Errors:
    - If class is public, class name and file name should be statement
    - Non-static variable/method can't ref in static context
    - Incompatible types

Data Types :
    (1) Primitive Data Type: Holding single values 
        - byte: 1
        - short: 2
        - int: 4
        - long:8

        - float:4
        - double:8

        - char:1

        -boolean:N/a

    (2) Ref Data Types: Hold multiple values
                        Ref data types and user defined data types printing address of objects except string

        - string
        - Array
        - SB 
        - SB 
        - Array

    (3) User Defined Data Types:
